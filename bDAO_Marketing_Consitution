BanklessDAO Marketing Guild Constitution v1.0
0x6f20
July 8th, 2022

I. Purpose
This Governance Framework provides guidance for Marketing Guild members regarding the organization and operations of the Guild, including the management of labor, and funding of projects within the Guild.
“An ideal constitution features a version of separation of powers intended both to grant political primacy to evolved cultural rules and to limit the influence of groups that demand interference with competitive social processes.” - Friedrich A. Hayek

Marketing Guild Mission
Our mission is to amplify the messages of BanklessDAO, by delivering creative Web3 marketing solutions to help BanklessDAO initiatives, partners, and clients get in front of the right people with the right message.

Marketing Guild Culture
The Marketing Guild seeks to foster a culture where creativity, experimentation, and play intersect to provide meaningful opportunities for our members to contribute to marketing services for BanklessDAO and external partners. The Guild will encourage and support members to build and contribute to projects that promote the DAO’s mission of onboarding 1 billion people to the Bankless ethos.

Marketing Guild Governance
Thoughtful governance means creating a flexible and secure framework that evolves as the Guild moves towards on-chain governance. A culture of experimentation and a marketplace of ideas is essential to ensure we continue to develop mechanisms for decision-making and task management. While we experiment and evolve, it is important we stay true and close to the BanklessDAO values and mission.

II. Guild Membership
Guild Entry
This section shall help new contributors to understand how they can get started after being onboarded to the guild, and also how to participate in the campaigns the Marketing Guild needs to deliver. To get started follow these steps:

Get role at #role-select
- Introduce yourself in #marketing-general + provide links to previous work, including design or writing samples, your crypto Twitter or Linkedin profiles, or portfolio
- Have an Onboarding Session with the Talent Coordinator (meeting time can be found in the bDAO Discord calendar) or coordinate directly to set up a time that works for you. A membership form must be completed in this step for the guild’s database. Here you will share relevant information, Discord handle, Notion e-mail, past working experience, skills, and any other important information that can be useful during the onboarding process
- Once onboarded, proceed to the Marketing Guild’s First Quest
- Marketing Guild’s First Quest
- The Marketing First Quest consists of two main areas, one content creation or campaign creation and the second one, engagement with our social media channels to help our growth. In the end, we are a media DAO, and our mission is to spread out the Bankless message.

Content Creation
Create a marketing activity that can help spread awareness about BanklessDAO, its mission, and its vision, and execute this through 3 different social media channels of your choice. This can be through your personal profiles or anon profiles, should be created if not. Once done, make sure to provide the links as proof of execution, by sharing them in the #marketing-general
channel.

Social Engagement
Interact and show some love to at least three of the following channels, according to your preferences:

- Follow BanklessDAO on Twitter
- Give a RT to the pinned tweet on our profile
- Subscribe to the BanklessDAO newsletter
- Follow on Instagram, Telegram, TikTok
- Show support on LinkedIn
- Join BanklessDAO at gm.xyz
- The Talent Coordinator guides new contributors through this process.

Guild Contribution
Once the First Quest is achieved, the contributor must contact the Talent Coordinator to inform the progress, will receive a POAP for completion, and is now considered an active contributor to the guild. Active contributors can now participate in two main areas:

Campaigns & Projects
For Campaigns/Projects, the new contributor can start his/her/their journey by applying to be a Campaign Lead for one of the following categories:

- Type A: BanklessDAO Campaign
- Type B: Project Campaigns
- Type C: External Campaigns
- Type D: bDAO Recommended Marketer
- Social Media/Content Creation

For Social Media/Content Strategy the new contributor can participate directly for now during the meeting being held on Wednesdays, 17:30 UTC, and can contact the guild’s Social Media Coordinator for more information.

🛠 An additional form of Guild Contribution is to have one of the Marketing Guild IV. Roles. This comes with fixed responsibilities and monthly payments. To become a role holder V. Elections will be held seasonally.

Number of signers
There are 7 owners for the Multi-Sig (Gnosis) Wallet. Every transaction requires the confirmation of 4 out of 7 owners.

Requirements for being a Mult-Sig Owner
Multi-Sig owners should have a fast response time to avoid financial bottlenecks. They also need to be experienced in the bDAO and have skin-in-the-game. For that reason, bDAO LvL 1 Status is required to be eligible to become a signer (owner) of the multi-sig wallet.

Request for Transaction
If there is a need for payment (i.e. bounty request) a short proposal and soft consensus in Discord is needed. It is advised to check with the Treasury/Governance Coordinator before reviewing available budgets.

Preparation and Execution of Transactions
Every transaction will be posted in #marketing-governance and the multi-sig owners have understood its details before signing it. Once 4 owners have signed the payment, it will be executed automatically.

IV. Roles
IV.I Role Governance
Eligibility for becoming a Role Holder
To be eligible for a role within the Marketing Guild a user needs to have at least a bDAO Guest Pass, completed the “Marketing Guild’s First Quest”, and actively contributed to any of the campaign types in the current season (see ”Guild Contribution”).

Role Responsibilities
Role holders are required to keep a record (within the Bankless DAO Notion) of their responsibilities and the tools needed to perform them. This record will be updated at the end of each season or upon the role holder’s departure. Role holders have the responsibility to develop and document their role holder work. They are obliged to handover the knowledge, login credentials, and best practices once a new person is elected for that role.

Role Payment
Role Holders carry out paid responsibilities that have been identified as crucial for the operational success of the Guild. Role holders receive a monthly payment from the Guild Treasury.

Unannounced Absence
If a role holder has an unannounced absence for >8 days (no messages or communication), the responsibilities, of that role holder will be bountied out via the Role Holder's Bounty pool or a temporary / substitute Role Holder will be appointed (vote) for the next 2 weeks. If the Role Holder does not return to resume their duties within the aforementioned 2 weeks, an election will be held to replace them. Throughout the election period, the duties of the role holder will be bountied out and paid for via the Role Holder's salary.

Revising Role (Responsibilities, New Roles, Deprecating Roles)
Proposals to modify responsibilities or salaries or creation/removal of roles should be made before the end of a season via VI. Initiatives / Proposals . If this is done in the middle of a season, funding needs to be secured with the GC for the remainder of that season.

The elections will be held on POAP.vote and token gated (requirement: at least 2 CC-Chat POAPS from the current season)

3 weeks before the end of the season
Elections will be announced by the Governance and Treasury Specialist. Guild members with an interest to become role holders will be requested to hand in an application (motive & vision, proof of previous work, “why me” statement, etc.) via the marketing governance Application Form below:
https://tally.so/r/wA78Kk

2 weeks before the end of the season
Elections will be open for 7 days. Depending on the number of applicants a two-ballot system or a binary vote will be opened.

1 week before the end of the season
Election results will be communicated and a countdown for “Article 1 - Appeal Against Election Results” will be started. Once the elections are fully confirmed, the role holder handover period will start until the new season starts.

V.II Election Types
Head to Head Election aka. Binary Vote
The candidate with the most votes wins. If the binary vote does not have >60% consensus the election will be invalid.

Multiple Candidates: Two Ballot System
If there are more than two options available, two ballots will be needed: The first to decide the two candidates moving to a Head to Head Election aka. Binary Vote

V.III Election Rules
Article 1 - Appeal Against Election Results
If someone wants to appeal the outcome of an election, he/she can call for an Appeal within 24h after the elections close. The Appeal requires written reasoning on why the election should be invalid and attached to a Seshbot vote to ask the guild if they want to approve or deny the Appeal. If approved, the previous election will be invalid.

Article 2 - Vote of No-Confidence
If a role holder does fulfill the required duties and therefore loses the trust of his/her peers, other role holders can call for a vote of No-Confidence: A binary vote (Seshbot) will be initiated that validates the guild trust in the questioned role holder. If >60% is not reached, the vote of No-Confidence will be invalid.

Article 3 - Invalid Elections
If the elections turn out invalid, the election will be re-created on a higher level of consensus (3 Layers of Consensus by Frogmonkee)

VI. Initiatives / Proposals
VI.I Proposal Types
- Social Proposal: Change things that don’t need on-chain involvement, such as elections, bounty ideas, etc. (Seshbot or Discord Emoji Reaction)
- Executable Proposal: involve smart contract execution by the wallets controlled by the guild. Please use this template: Project Proposal Template (frogmonkee)
- Constitution Amendment: as the name indicates, are changes proposed to the guild constitution. This vote is for bDAO Level 1 and higher. If you would like to propose a change to the constitution, please create a Pull Request on GitHub: https://github.com/voellmy42/MarketingGuildConstitution

VI.II Guild Governance Framework
This is a guidance framework. Feel free to do what you think is right for your particular proposal (e.g. if it’s a simple proposal and needs to be advanced quickly you may move to the voting stage). Note: if your idea doesn’t require guild funds or the addition/revision/depreciation of a guild role or active program, then you probably don’t need to follow this process and can just do a temperature and awareness check via messages in the appropriate guild channel.

Ideation
- Share an idea in #marketing-governance to get some quick feedback
- Do a quick vibe-check on Discord with Emoji Reactions: 👍 vs👎

Proposal Draft
- Depending on the VI.I Proposal Types you can start drafting the proposal
- Signal in #marketing-governance that you’re working on it so that co-authors can signal interest in collaborating (i.e. work in the open)

Discussion/Revision
- Receive comments in #marketing-governance
- Option: LettuceMeet to coordinate feedback/advice calls where needed
- Redraft the proposal and communicate in #marketing-governance when changes happen

Voting (Consensus Check)
- Proposal updated to status ‘Voting’ with link to the sesh poll
- Use a @seshbot poll that is open for at least 72h to get guild consensus
- Be sure to clearly label it as a ‘consensus vote’ and use the @marketing-guild tag when posting so the guild is notified for maximum participation
- All binary (yes/no) type votes require a 60% consensus to pass, all non-binary votes or variations required must be defined in the proposal and clearly state thresholds/mechanics for a successful consensus.

Closing and Treasury Distributions
- The proposal is updated to the status ‘Closed’ and a decision summary is recorded
- Guild coordinator role notified (if not aware) to rally the multi-sig signers
- Signers sign transaction(s)
